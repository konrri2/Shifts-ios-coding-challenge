# Shifts-ios-coding-challenge


## Assumptions I've made:

The simplest UI possible

Use project settings as provided, eg. `iOS version == 14`

Do not use gitflow - no branches for simple proof-of-concept (spike-solution) project


## TODO:

Adding shift to system calendar 

UI improvements, eg. pull-to-refresh (this would be easy with `.refreshable` available in iOS 15) 

Add error messages in case of problem - discuss with UI designer first

Add search parameters, eg. `radius`

Replace all `print("ðŸ›‘` with proper logging system (at least os_log)

Make api and request builder dynamic for different requests 

Cacheing data to show something if there is no internet connection



## To discuss:

### API:
Time zones eg. `start_time` vs. `normalized_start_date_time`
